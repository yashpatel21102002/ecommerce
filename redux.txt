Redux is state management library.
// better state management in applications
// Redux is not specific to react.
// can be used in any framework like angular , vue, vanilla etc.
// provides single store that you can use to manage a large amount of data
// installation => npm i @redux-toolkit react-redux

==> How to Create the Redux Store 
you use the store to manage and track the data that's changing in the application.
// Create store using
import {createStore} from 'redux'
//createStore function accepts three arguments
1.first is known as reducer
2.second one is the initial value of the state.
3. enhancer where we can pass middleware

//basic code 
import {createStore} from 'reduc'

const reducer = (state,action)=>{
    console.log("reducer called")
    return state;

}

const store =  createStore(reducer,0);

//createSlice is a higher order function that accepts an initial state , an object full of reducer functions and a slice name.

//It automativally generates action creators and action types that correspond to the correspond to the reducer and state.


-----------------
Provider 
The <provider> Component makes the redudx store available to any nested components that need to accesss the redux store.
since any react component in a react redux app can be connected to the store , most applications will render a provider at the top level . with the entire app's component tree inside of it.
